Welcome to the Metamaps GitHub repo. 

## About

Metamaps is a free and AGPL open source technology for changemakers, innovators, educators and students. It enables individuals and communities to build and visualize their shared knowledge and unlock their collective intelligence. You can find out about more about the project at the [blog][site-blog].

You can find a version of this software running at [metamaps.cc][site-beta], where the technology is being tested in a private beta.

Metamaps is created and maintained by a distributed, nomadic community comprised of technologists, artists and storytellers. You can get in touch with us at team@metamaps.cc or @metamapps on twitter. 

To get connected with the community interested in Metamaps, join our [Google+ community][community].

## Installation

If you are on Mac or Ubuntu you can use the following instructions to quickly get a local copy of metamaps up and running using a Vagrant virtualbox. Don't be intimidated, it's easy!
```
git clone git@github.com:metamaps/metamaps_gen002.git
```
Now ensure you have VirtualBox and Vagrant installed on your computer
```
cd metamaps_gen002
./configure.sh
```
This will do all the setup steps to make Metamaps work with a bit of behind the scenes ninja magick.

To start servers which will run metamaps you can then run:
```
./bin/start
```
To stop them:
```
./bin/stop
```
With your webservers running, open a web browser and go to `http://localhost:3000`

You can sign in with the default account
email: `user@user.com`
password: `toolsplusconsciousness`
OR create a new account at `/join`, and use access code `qwertyui`

Start mapping and programming!

While we are still figuring out vagrant for Windows, there is an older set of instructions below
